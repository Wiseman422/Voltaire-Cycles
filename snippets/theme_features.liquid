In order to reduce the number of theme settings, some features can be enabled/disabled through those special
Liquid variables. You can turn them on and off to change some features.

Here is a short documentation:

- theme_features_slider_crop: by default, when your slider overlaps the header, we force a minimum height (of 700 pixels), and the
image will be adjusted to fit into this space. As a consequence, some of your image may be cropped. If you want, you can turn this option
to false, and instead Focal will not resize the image. However, you'll need to make sure that you upload a sufficiently tall images
so that all your content can fit over the images.

- theme_features_collection_enable_tag_filtering: allow to disable or enable the filtering by tags in collection pages.

- theme_features_collection_enable_sorting: allow to disable or enable the sorting of products in collection pages.

- theme_features_collection_enable_cumulative_tag_filtering: if set to true, product tags are cumulative (which means that clicking on another tag
will add this tag to reduce even further the list
